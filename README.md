Install Instructions
----

Step 1: Install script mod

	- Copy modBetterKeybinds into your %GAMEDIR%\mods directory

Step 2: Install new rebind menu

	- input.xml location: %GAMEDIR%\bin\config\r4game\user_config_matrix\pc\input.xml
	- Backup old input.xml (I normally zip into input.xml.old.zip)
	- Copy new one and overwrite
	- If have a mod that already changes this file, you can easily merge the two, my changes are clearly marked, though I would use mine as a base

Step 3: Add in new keybinds (not bound to anything)

	- input.settings default location: %My Documents%\The Witcher 3\input.settings
	- Backup old input.settings
	- Open input.settings.BetterKeybinds.txt
	- Copy entire contents of input.settings.BetterKeybinds.txt
	- Paste into input.settings at the TOP
